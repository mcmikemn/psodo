          mount: /mnt/config
          fs_type: ext4

        ## Set your full qualified (sub-)domain that traefik manages:
        domain: sub.domain.tld
        ## Set your email address here (for letsencrypt):

        ## Set the LetsEncrypt CA-server
        ## use https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory for staging environment

        caserver: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

        acme_dir: /mnt/config/traefik
        ## It is more secure to leave the traefik dashboard turned off, you probably don't need it:
        dashboard_enable: false
        ## If you do turn on the dashboard, it will use this username:
        username: traefik
        ## If you do turn on the dashboard, it will use this password:
        password: traefik
      photostructure:
        ## Set Photostructure full qualified domain name (must be same as traefik.domain, above)

          - host: /storage/photos
            container: /storage/photos-syncthing
        ## Set Syncthing listening port

        ## Set Syncthing protocol discovery port
        discovery_port: 21027
        ## set UID that Syncthing runs as
        uid: 1000
        ## set GID tht Syncthing runs as

        config_root: /mnt/config/sftp
        ## Set sftp user(s)
        ## Syncthing runs as UID 1000, so if you want to have both Syncthing and SFTP manage the same directory, only add one SFTP user and set its UID to 1000. 
        ## Each user must have unique name and uid, and should have a unique host directory
        users:
          - name: user1

            uid: 1000
            gid: 100
            ## Set 1 or more directories on host to share in sftp user home
